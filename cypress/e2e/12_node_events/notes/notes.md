# Node events
Cypress tests run in browser. But setting up `setupNodeEvents()` function can give you access to the node.js environment as well. And you can do that while you are running your tests in the browser. This can be super useful for stuff like seeding your database, checking downloaded files and much more. Additionaly, this function can help you out with resolving your configuration, so that you can use the same tests for multiple versions of your app (like local, staging, production).

Mentioned cases can be handled by two parameters of the `setupNodeEvents()` function. This function looks something like this in our `cypress.config.js` file:

```js
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {

}
```

## on
This is a function that letâ€™s us tap in to many of the runtime events. The most frequently used is `task` which happens whenever we call `cy.task()` in our test. Cool thing is that we get to define our own tasks and let Cypress knwo what it should do when e.g. a task with a name `seedDatabase` will run. This definitions are inside our `cypress.config.js` file. The whole structure of the browser -> node communication can be explained by a diagram:

![Node events](./nodeEvents.png)

This script can be anything you can run in node! Imagine that this will do a select query in your database or find a file in your filesystem. Options are endless!

## config
This is an object that contains all the configuration attributes. Having access to this enables us to change the configuration while Cypress is opening. This will work both for interactive (`npx cypress open`) and headless mode (`npx cypress run`). There are many ways we can use this. Imagine you want to run all your tests in different resolution while a `MOBILE=true` environment variable is set. All you need to do is to set your `setupNodeEvents()` function:

```js
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
  config.viewportWidth = config.env.MOBILE && 300
  config.viewportHeight = config.env.MOBILE && 600
  return config
}
```

And then run your tests like this: `npx cypress open --env MOBILE=true`

## How is configuration resolved?
There are multiple ways of resolving configuration and using `setupNodeEvents()` function is just one of them. [They follow a hierarchy which you can read more about here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration).
